        <p>Hello! I am a Humanities Major with a minor in Ancient Languages and Computer Information Technology. With that degree I want to be an archivist or  collections manager for a library or museum.</p>
        <p>I am from Wisconsin, but originally from Chicago so I am a huge Bears, Cubs, Bulls, and Blackhawks fan. I love walking/hiking, the above picture is of me (on the left) and my cousin (on the right) hiking around Mt. Rainier in the state of Washington. I also love reading and watching movies, my favorite movie of all time is A Knight's Tale with Heath Ledger. I also love playing video games. Mostly Overwatch, Stardew Valley, Super Mario, and sometimes Minecraft with friends.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church my entire life. My favorite scripture is Matthew 11:28-30</p>
        <p>"28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me: for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."</p>
